This website introduces FullMonte, the fastest mesh-based Monte Carlo software model available.

Modeling of light propagation through turbid (highly-scattering) media such as living tissue is important for a number of medical applications including diagnostics and therapeutics. FullMonte Software provides  methods of performing such simulations quickly and accurately.

As input, the Geometry Specifications and Material Optical properties should be provided. The light absorption and trace of light is generated as the result of FullMonte Software which could be visulaized in VTK.
